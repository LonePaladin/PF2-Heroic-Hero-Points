# PF2-Heroic-Hero-Points

# This is my first attempt at creating a Foundry module, so bear with me.

# It seeks to automate a house rule I use, which is itself dervied from a blog post by Owen K. C. Stephens (linked below).
# Essentially, if someone spends a Hero Point to reroll a d20 on a check, if the result on the die is 10 or less, add +10 to the total result of the check.
# Note that this does NOT change the behavior of rolling a natural 1 or 20, and that rolling a 10 does NOT count as a NATURAL 20 even though it gets the same total.

# The blog post: https://owenkcstephens.com/2021/07/30/pf2-hero-point-feats/
# Credit goes to Owen for the idea, I just chose to make it a rule instead of requiring three feats to get it.
